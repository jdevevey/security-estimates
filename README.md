This script supports the experimental section of AC22 accepted submission titled
"On Rejection Sampling in Lyubashevsky's Signature Scheme" 
 
This script is a modification of the one for Dilithium, available at
https://github.com/pq-crystals/security-estimates

For comparisons, we rely on the following, referred to as Dilithium-NIST:
https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/data/dilithium-specification-round3-20210208.pdf
 
For comparisons, we also rely on the following, referred to as Dilithium-G:
https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2017/633&version=20170627:201152&file=633.pdf

Usage: run "signature_security_estimator.py" to compute estimated security as well as estimated sizes.
This script is easily customisable and can be run for other parameter sets.
See signature_security_estimator.py for more information
